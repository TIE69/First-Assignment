        <p class="main-para">Failure is an inevitable part of life that everyone experiences. It is a normal and natural occurrence that can lead to learning and personal growth. While it can be difficult and emotional, it is important to remember that failure is only temporary and should not be viewed as a permanent defeat. Instead, it is an opportunity to try again and do better.</p>
